## Navigation
I didn't use native compose navigation API as I found it a bit verbose and excessive. Instead a used a great easy to use community API by [Rafael Costa](github.com/raamcosta/) called [compose destinations](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations), which was easy to use for a compose beginner like me.
